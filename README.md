# CS162_Fall23_Lab10

Hello, this is my code for my CS 162 (intro to programming) Lab #10, it focused on recursion and utilization of lists. For the first part of the lab we had a worksheet regarding Big O Complexity Analysis as well as Lists vs. Arrays. The second portion of the lab was creating Recursive Fractals from scratch that could show a pattern of stars and white spaces, my recursive.cpp file does this but you do need to manually change x and y based on desired output. The final portion of the lab was a Remove Nth Node from end of list, given prior hard code information by Professor Yipeng Song or (Roger), given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head. I provided the code in this repo for both the hard coded informational portion and my code in the solution2.cpp. This is my first ever repo so excited to join the space :)
